## SnapCI
[![Build Status](https://snap-ci.com/kristofferahl/cicd-pipelines/branch/master/build_image)](https://snap-ci.com/kristofferahl/cicd-pipelines/branch/master)
- Hosted
- Docker support is "by request" only

- No declarative configuration, yet
- Renaming a repository results in a broken pipeline (connection could not be repaired)
- Unable to clone pipeline from one repository to another
- A bit immature..?
